#None type Data_type :
#=>'None Type' is one the pre-defined class and treated as None type Data type
#"None" is keyword acts as value for <class,'NoneType'>
#=>The value of 'None' is not False, Space , empty , 0
#=>An object of NoneType class can't be created explicitly.

#Number of approaches to develop python programs:we have 2 approaches
#--->Interactive Mode
#--->Batch Mode
#a) Interactive Mode:This Mode of Development, The Python Programmer Issued One statement and got its result immediately and such statements can't be saved . So that we can't re-use in further applications development.
'''a="abc"
b="xyz"
print(a,b)
abc xyz'''
#Batch Mode:In Batch Mode Programming, we develop batch of optimized instructions for
#solving any problem statement and it saved on filename with an extension .py(Source Code).

#Displaying the Result (or) Data on the Console:
#=>To Display the Result of Python Program , we use pre-defined Function called print()
'''a="abc"
b="xyz"
print(a,b)
abc xyz
a=10
print(a)
10
b="python"
print(b)
python'''

'''a=10
b=20
c=a+b
print("sum of {} and {}={}".format(a,b,c))
sum of 10 and 20=30'''

#Reading the Data (or) Input Values from Key Board:
#=>To read the data Dynamically from Keyboard, we have 2 pre-defined functions. They are
#a) input() : =>input() is used reading any type of data / value dynamically from keyboard in the form of str always.
#b) input(Message) : => This function is used for reading any type of data / value dynamically from keyboard in the form of str always and additionally it gives User-Prompting Message.
